# Tasks
In this GUI, a user is able to type in a certain number of tasks that they need to do or have done throughout the day.
Once the user has inputted all of those, they may either click the green or red in order to check off success or failure respectively. 
Once they are done with those they may press done in order to lock the task that they have done. 
After all of this they may click finish in order to see a stacked bar graph of their productivity that day 
and how many items they completed and how many items they did not complete.
